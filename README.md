HANGMAN
=======

Hangman is an educational classic word-guessing games or a puzzle for one or more players by picking the letter. 

It is originally from a paper and pencil guessing game. 

Scores will be added or subtracted depends on what letter you picked. 

It has the maximum letter of number for the wrong letters until you get it immediately. 

This game was built with HTML5.


HOW TO PLAY HANGMAN
===================

Choose one person to be the "host." This is the person that invents the puzzle for the other person to solve. 

They will be tasked with choosing a word or phrase that "the players" will have to solve.

The host should be able to spell confidently or the game will be impossible to win.

If you are the host, choose a secret word. 

The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so choose a word you think will be difficult to guess. 

Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like "z," or "j," and only a few vowels.

For longer games, you can also choose phrases.


STRATEGY
========

The twelve most commonly occurring letters are, in descending order: e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u. 

This and other letter-frequency lists are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess.

On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word which deliberately avoids

common letters (e.g. rhythm or zephyr) or one that contains rare letters (e.g. jazz).

When you play this game, the best strategy is to guest vowel first.
